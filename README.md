This project uses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, for instance segmentation to classify drivable and non-drivable regions in complex terrains. The model is trained on annotated off-road images and demonstrates high accuracy in detecting drivable regions.

## Features
- **Instance Segmentation:** Differentiates drivable regions from obstacles such as rocks, trees, and rough terrain.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Processes images to identify paths in off-road scenarios with high precision.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes resizing, augmentation, and annotation refinement for robust model training.
- **Scalable Framework:** Can be extended to include path planning and obstacle avoidance.

## Data Collecting and Cleaning

**Dataset:**

The Dataset used for the Experiment to identify the Terrain is Cat: CAVS Traversability Dataset which consists 
of 3.45k Off-Road Terrain images which were collected by Mississippi State University and is stated in. The 
data collection was performed near HPCC (High Performance Company Collaboratory) of Mississippi State 
University. The data is collected from three trails i.e., main trail with a length of 0.64 km , powerline trail with 
a length of 0.82 km, brownfield trail with a length of 0.21 km . The images were collected considering the 
required light exposure with different filters compatible with Sekonix SF3325-100 camara model.
